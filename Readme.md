Welcome to the Realtime DDoS Detection System (RDDoS)! We promise, it's not just another acronym in the sea of tech jargon. This project combines cutting-edge code wizardry and some serious tinkering in the lab to fend off those pesky DDoS attacks. So grab your coffee, put on your coding gloves, and let's dive into the cyber battleground!
